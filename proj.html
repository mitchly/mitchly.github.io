        <p>A solution to traditional waveform viewers. By using a command line interface, hardware debugging becomes <br>
            easier and quicker. A VCD file/PyTRL code is inputted along with query language to output an SVG. (Ongoing)</p>

        <p><a href="https://github.com/mitchly/cs8_cryptographyFINAL">Cryptography: Encoding and Decoding (Fall 2020)</a></p>
        <p>The user can choose to either encode or decode a message by providing a string message and a key. The key is <br> 
            an integer value that tells the program to parse through the ASCII table a certain amount. (Complete)

        <p><a href="https://github.com/mitchly/cmpsc130a_pa1">Bloom Filters (Winter 2022)</a></p>
        <p>Creating a implement a data structure to hold a large set of elements that supports looking up for objects in constant time O(1) with</p>
        <p>a large amount of data. Bloom Filters are an efficient due to them being space-efficient, memory-efficient, and probabilistic. </p>
        <p>This project mimics commonly used bloom filters that can be found in weak password or username detection and safe browsing. (Complete)</p>

        <p><a href="https://github.com/mitchly/cmspc130a_pa2">Social Networks (Winter 2022)</a></p>
        <p>This project mimics social networks, often depicted in social media apps. It can detect what entities are within a social network,</p> 
        <p>relationships between entities, and utilize an assumption of locality through the use of graphs. (Complete)</p>

        <p>An active piezo buzzer will sound out a randomly generated string in dots and dashes. Player will type out the correct string on Termite.</p>
        <p>If correct, score increments by one and is displayed on a 1602 LCD. Else, the score remains the same. (Complete)</p>

        <p><a href=>Artificial Intelligence: Classifier Agent (Spring 2023)</a></p>
        <p>Design an agent to read movie reviews and decide whether the review is positive or negative. Contains feature extractor class and classifier-agent</p> 
        <p>class. Feature extractor processes a review into a bag of words feature vector. The classifier-agent class contains the functionalities of a binary</p>
